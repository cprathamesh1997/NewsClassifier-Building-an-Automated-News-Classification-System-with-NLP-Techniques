## ▶️Implementation
### The project is implemented using Python and several libraries, including requests, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and scikit-learn. 

## The implementation involves the following steps➡️

## ▶️Web Scraping and Data Extraction: 
### The script extracts news articles from a designated website using the requests library and parses HTML content using BeautifulSoup.

## ▶️Data Preprocessing: 
### News article titles are cleaned by removing HTML tags, non-alphabetic characters, and stopwords. The text is tokenized, lemmatized, and converted into TF-IDF matrices for further analysis.

## ▶️Clustering Similar Articles: 
### K-means clustering is applied to group similar articles based on their content. Each article is represented as a vector in the TF-IDF space, and K-means clustering is used to identify clusters of similar articles.

## ▶️Building a Classification Model:
### A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained using TF-IDF vectors of article titles. The model is evaluated for accuracy and generates a classification report.

## ▶️Results:
### The NewsClassifier successfully automates the clustering and classification of news articles from the target website. The system provides insights into the content structure of the website and accurately categorizes articles into distinct clusters.

## ▶️Conclusion:
### The NewsClassifier project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP techniques in automating news classification tasks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and text processing methods, the system streamlines the analysis and categorization of large volumes of news articles, facilitating quick access to relevant information.
